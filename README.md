# Retail-Insights-from-Superstore-Data

# Project Description

I utilized VS Code with Jupyter Notebook to analyze a superstore dataset, leveraging technologies such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The analysis process commenced with data cleaning, where I identified and handled null values, followed by removing outliers from relevant columns like PROFIT to ensure data accuracy.

Once the dataset was clean, I proceeded with visualizations to derive insights:

Histograms: Used for numerical columns to understand data distribution.

Boxplots: Identified and addressed any remaining anomalies or patterns.

Bar Chart: Highlighted sales trends by sub-category, revealing key business insights.

# Who Are the End Users?

Inventory Managers

Business Executives

Furniture and Office Supply Retailers

Procurement Teams

Marketing Teams

# Technology Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Development Environment: VS Code with Jupyter Notebook

Operating System: Windows 10

## Results

# 1. Boxplot Analysis

The outliers present in the Profit column were removed, ensuring a refined dataset free from extreme variations.

# 2. Histogram Analysis

The histograms illustrated data distribution across numerical columns. For example:

The Sales column displayed a clustering of values within a specific range, indicating typical sales performance.

The Quantity column highlighted the frequency of different quantities sold.

The Profit column depicted the distribution of profit values across the dataset.

# 3. Bar Chart Analysis

The bar chart revealed that the sub-category 'Copiers' had the highest sales, while 'Fasteners' had the lowest sales among all categories.

This analysis provides valuable insights for inventory management, marketing strategies, and procurement planning, aiding business decision-making in the retail domain.
